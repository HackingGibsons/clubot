# Clubot
It's kind of like an IRC bot, but I hope it'll just be a bridge.

In summary, it's sweet as hell.

# Quickstart
Clone the repo

```
$ # Clone the repo
$ git clone url/here/clubot.git
$ cd clubot
$ # Set up the project
$ # (asdf, submodules, cast the darks spells to invoke the names of the ancients in eternal slumber)
$ make develop
$ # Repl
$ sbcl
* (ql:quickload :clubot) ;; Load the system
* (clubot:clubot) ;; Run which might even do something!
```
